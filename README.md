# NOTICE

I was using this github repo for a college project that required website hosting. This is why you will see react.js project stuff in the deleted history on this repo. However, I am now repurposing this repo for my own personal portfolio. At the end of this project, I will upload a folder containing all of my planning documentation to show the planning process that can go behind the development process.
